# Golang Web Application Template Repo

This repo helps to setup some of the boilerplate for a Golang web application. The repository structure is informed by how we manage Kanopy applications and should adhere to guidance in our [coding style guide](https://github.com/10gen/infrastructure-handbook/tree/master/docs/code/style).

Usage
```
# build from templates
make

# reset build changes
git checkout .
make clean
```
